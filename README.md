# Plant-disease-detection
This detector uses camera to detect the diseases caused to leaves and predicts it with accuracy
Disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture as farmers have often to decide whether the crop they are harvesting is good enough. It is of utmost importance to take this seriously as it can lead to serious problems in plants due to which product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. Plant diseases cause a periodic outbreak of diseases leading to large-scale death which severely affects the economy. Here computer vision algorithms can be used to provide image-based automatic inspection.
The PROJECT FILE has the CNN model that is built using Plant leaf dataset from Kaggle
The Live Demo ipynb file directly access the web camera and detects the disease of leaf with good accuracy using pre-trained algorithm from Project File.
